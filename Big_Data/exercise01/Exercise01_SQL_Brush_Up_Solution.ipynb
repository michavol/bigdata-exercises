If we redundantly store the artist's ID and name in `releases`, the aforementioned query now only requires a `SELECT` instead of an expensive `JOIN`. As releases can be released by multiple artists, we could also extend this idea and break 1NF by storing a list of artist names instead. The tradeoff here is that every time we have to update an artist's name we have to find and update all releases by that artist. Considering that reads are very common and changes are rare, the option of denormalizing becomes relatively more attractive.\n",

       " Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-The-Bends/master/17008]The Bends[/url]&quot; (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man [a=Thom Yorke]&#x27;s expressive singing. The album featured the hits &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-High-Dry-Planet-Telex/release/199387]High &amp; Dry[/url]&quot;, &quot;[r=1463625]&quot; and &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Fake-Plastic-Trees/master/21526]Fake Plastic Trees[/url]&quot;. \r\n",

       " The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/master/21491]OK Computer[/url]&quot; (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990&#x27;s, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-Kid-A/master/21501]Kid A[/url]&quot; (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.\r\n",

After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released &quot;[url=http://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-In-Rainbows/master/21520]In Rainbows[/url]&quot; (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  &quot;[url=https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-A-Moon-Shaped-Pool/master/998252]A Moon Shaped Pool[/url]&quot;, was released in May 2016.\r\n",

Each iteration joins the `collaborations` relation to find artists within one more hop for each artist already found. It keeps track of the distance from the original post by incrementing the value of ```distance``` by one in each iteration. When that attribute reaches the value of ```X```, no records are produced by the recursive case, so recursion ends.\n",
